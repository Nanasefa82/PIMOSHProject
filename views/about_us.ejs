              <br />

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>At PIMOSH, we envision a world where every child experiences opportunities to unlock their 
                  full potential and unleash their creativity through the power of arts and technology 
                  education. We believe that every child is capable of greatness and are committed to 
                  empowering, inspiring, and igniting their passions, nurturing their talents, and 
                  encouraging them to dream big. 
              <br />
              <br />
              Together, we will bridge the gap of opportunity, fostering a community where every child 
              is valued, supported, and challenged to achieve their wildest aspirations, where no dream 
              is too big, and no challenge is too great. We will create a brighter future for every 
              child and leave a lasting legacy of innovation, inspiration, and hope.

            <h3>Diversity Statement</h3>
            <p>Diversity and inclusion are core values of PIMOSH. Every person has unique experiences, 
                  perspectives, and talents that contribute to the richness and strength of our 
                  organization. We are committed to creating an inclusive environment where all 
                  individuals feel respected, valued, and empowered. We actively seek out and welcome 
                  overachieving individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences and actively work 
                  to remove barriers to participation and success.<br />
              <br />
              We recognize that diversity goes beyond race and ethnicity. It also encompasses 
              differences in gender, age, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, religion, abilities, 
              and more. We work hard to create a positive, welcoming, and inclusive environment for all 
              members and participants of our organization. We will strive to develop a culture of equity 
              where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and feels a sense of belonging.
              <br />
              <br />
              We also acknowledge that inclusion and diversity are ongoing efforts. We will continuously 
              work to identify and address any implicit bias, discrimination, and barriers that prevent 
              individuals from fully participating in our programs and initiatives. We are committed to 
              taking action and being held accountable for creating a genuinely inclusive environment.
              <br />
              <br />
              We believe that embracing diversity and inclusion is not only the right thing to do but 
              also essential to the success of our organization and the communities we serve.

                    Academic Tutorial & Mentoring Services is 
                    where it all started, back in 2002 - 
                    Sliding into twenty years. Students will 
                    always excel, and on the flip side, some 
                    need and want extra help and deserve it 
                    (service). The Summer Tutorial & Enrichment 
                    Program (STEP) was created to re-live, revive, 
                    and step up the learning getting ready for 
                    what's to come.

                    It's challenging to measure educational 
                    programs outside of pre and post-tests in most 
                    programs. Still, through PIMOSH, we have moved 
                    the ZERO student to HERO status in no time, with 
                    simple social skills building techniques and 
                    individual curricula design.

        <br />
        We also acknowledge that inclusion and diversity are ongoing efforts. We will continuously 
        work to identify and address any implicit bias, discrimination, and barriers that prevent 
        individuals from fully participating in our programs and initiatives. We are committed to 
        taking action and being held accountable for creating a genuinely inclusive environment.
        <br />
        <br />
